<h3 align="center">Final-year Computer Science Student | Software Developer | Tech Enthusiast</h3>

💫 **About Me:**

I'm Aditya Chauhan, a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student from New Delhi with a strong passion for Software Development, AI, and Full-Stack Engineering. My journey through coding began with C++ and has expanded to include Python, JavaScript, Django, and more.

I enjoy solving real-world problems through innovative tech solutions—some of my favorite work includes building intelligent applications like **GestureMath AI**, **Prepwise**, and **DevBOT**, blending creativity with functionality. I also have hands-on experience in open-source development, data handling, and API integrations.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me organizing college events, playing volleyball at interstate levels, or watching a Marvel marathon with my girlfriend!

⚡ I believe in continuous learning and love building impactful software that makes lives easier.
